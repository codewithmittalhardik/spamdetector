# 📧 SMS/Email Spam Classifier

A machine learning-based web application that classifies SMS or Email messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**. The app uses a pre-trained model to analyze text in real-time and provide instant predictions.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Prediction**: Instantly classifies messages as you type or paste them.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Automatically handles tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- **Simple UI**: Built with Streamlit for a clean and responsive user interface.
- **Model Transparency**: Uses a pre-trained Naive Bayes/Machine Learning model (`model.pkl`).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **NLP**: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
